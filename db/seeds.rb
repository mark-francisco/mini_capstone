# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# new_seeded_product = Product.create({:name => "sneakers", :price => 80, :image_url => "sneaker_image_1", :description => "white leather sneakers with minimal design."})

# new_seeded_product = Product.create({:name => "boots", :price => 130, :image_url => "boots_image_2", :description => "waterproof leather winter boots"})
